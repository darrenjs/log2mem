log2mem
=======

List of next features
=====================

* build a QT based GUI for interacting with the memmap

* support atomics on i386 targets  (should work on Suse 9.3, which lacks atomics)

* review the output format, is it acceptabile?  E.g., current the date is not
  presnet.

* implement filename selection (see TODOs). review the choice of default
  filename.  Is it really /tmp/log2mem.dat?  If so, it will cause a lot of
  runtime problems when the file cannot be created.

* support a logging daemon; allow tailing of memmap contents

* benchmarking: can I find out how long it takes to perform a logging operation?

* when the global handle is first obtained, maybe store the program pid
  there, so that we can also print the pid on each line (together with the
  lwp).

* log2mem should dump the time as the first item on the line

* maybe add a timestamp in the header, to show when last updated ... this is so
  that we can see if the application is moving

* in xdumptool, at startup, check the arch of the memmap, to see if it is
  compatible.

* try to use, as much as possible, values from the memmap, when building
  pointers.

* try to find the GC macro needed to enable the atomi_gnu include

* find where I am using _LP, and instead, if it is in a printf, use the PRI
  macros instead.

* decide whether to keep the logging ... instead, could optionally do printf,
  if configured to do so

* provide functions to assoicate names with thread ids (how to do maps in C?)

* allow the dump tool to colourize differnent threads (how to do maps in C?)

* review whether we need to have mem_seq_cst orders on the atomic ints... not
  sure if we do, because we are not two shared variables.

* provide an atomic incr for unsigned int

* change counter type to unsigned int, and wrap in atomic_uint
